# 🌳 GREN - Making Lifestyle Sustainable 🌎

## 💡Inspiration
_Stat:_ <br/> 
👉 Mother nature is already taking hits from the poor choices of us human beings where we leave behind Carbon Footprints from the food we consume to the Toilet paper we use. <br/>
👉 Do you know? Just one liter of Coke costs us **346 gm** of Carbon Dioxide from manufacture to our refrigerator and Mega roll of Ultra Smooth Toilet paper leaves **771 gm** CO2… Yes! Twice than Coke.  <br/>
<br/>
_Survey:_ <br/> 
👉 Figures like these ignited curiosity and got us thinking if Big MNCs are adopting low Carbon goods then why can’t we?  <br/>
👉 On doing a quick local survey we found out 7 in 10 people didn’t know about alternatives at all or where to buy them. <br/>
<br/>
_Approach:_ <br/> 
👉 So we Solved this exact problem by introducing our product **GREN -  Making Lifestyle Sustainable** <br/>

## ♻️ What it does
**GREN** provides a one-stop solution for all the daily needs by suggesting eco alternatives based on the product's Carbon Footprint while promoting Recycling of Waste by monetizing it, and a Personalized Analysis Dashboard for your contribution to the cause.
<br/><br/>
**We have the following features:** <br/>
1. Familiar UI for the everyday e-Commerce shopping experience<br/>
2. Product listings with their Carbon Footprint UI for a better choice <br/>
3. ECO IMPACT description to let the user know about the impact on the environment <br/>
4. **Alternative** ECO Product Suggestion with comparison
Providing Discounts and **FREE Shipping** in exchange for _recyclable_ waste. 
5. **Carbon Footprint Dashboard** to the analysis of your contribution with visualizations on the basis of past purchases.

## 🛠️ How we built it
**Ideation** <br/>
👉 Each member put forward their perspective and we collectively brainstormed towards the solution using flashcards and micro pitching. <br/><br/>
**Prototyping** <br/>
👉 We took the wireframes and created an interactive prototype using Figma. <br/><br/>
**Deep Learning Model** <br/>
👉 We used ResNet CNN architecture to perform Garbage Detection (Glass, Metal, Paper. Plastic, trash, etc.) and count them.
**Website** <br/>
We made a website to make create awareness about the cause. <br/>

## 🗻 Challenges we ran into
* To come up with a suitable metric for product evaluation and gathering relevant data.<br/>
* To come up with a practical idea that would create a positive impact on the environment while keeping it feasible.<br/>
* Implementing the solution from Figma Prototype to working app. <br/>
* The most challenging part of our project was assuring all team members were on the same page. <br/>

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Completing the project prototype that is important to the earth, despite all the challenges mentioned.  <br/>
* Even if we manage to bring positive change in ourselves towards the cause it's a big achievement for us. <br/>
 
## 📖 What we learned
* Teamwork and commitment towards the goal <br/>
* Time management and the importance of effective communication. <br/>
* Figma Prototyping <br/>
* Change in perspective towards products we use. <br/>

## 🚀 What's next for GREN - Making Lifestyle Sustainable
* Creating a social community with users' social carbon footprint ratings.
* Browser Extension to reach masses while providing fundamental features in an extension on e-Commerce giants like Amazon.
